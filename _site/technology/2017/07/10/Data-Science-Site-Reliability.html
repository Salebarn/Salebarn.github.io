  <article class="post-content">
    <p>First of all, if your sales and marketing infrastructure is not your very most important business infrastructure, don’t read any further … seriously … this Salebarn technology blog post is definitely not for people who do not have to worry about the quality of the interaction with their customers.</p>

<p>Second of all, this Salebarn technology blog post is about absolutely RELYING on web, mobile, SMS communication IT in order to effect a MORE DIRECT, MORE PERSONAL, MORE CONTINUOUS, HIGHER QUALITY relationship with your customers … this second warning is even more seriously than the first … if you have already permanently decided that you will never be able to trust a technological communication channel, don’t read any further … this Salebarn technology blog post is definitely not for people who do not understand that their customers WANT to be engaged primarily over technological communication channels, so that they don’t have to waste time driving around or doing things inefficiently in order to find interesting products, services, people.</p>

<p>Finally and most seriously, this Salebarn technology blog post is NOT the solution to all of your problems in this topical realm … if you are looking for either magic bullets or permanent lasting fixes, GO AWAY … continuously updated, upgraded KNOWLEDGE is the solution to those problems and it will be necessary to continually upgrade and update that knowledge.</p>

<p>If you find this blog post helpful, GREAT … no need to thank us; as with ALL bloggers in the history of blogging – we wrote this posting for ourselves – it is part of our own training plan … as all educators knows, it is the attempting to train others that trains us the best, ie no one can possibly learn more in any classroom than the teacher carefully, thoughtfully presenting the material in that classroom.</p>

<p>This particular blog post is intended to be somewhat evergreen – but, of course, a technology post obviously CANNOT POSSIBLY BE truly evergreen.  As with ALL podcasts, especially podcasts in the ‘technology’ category, this podcast will be dated even before it is saved, before it is published.</p>

<p>If you find our approach to problem solving and building knowledge useful and want us to apply our expertise to YOUR particular problem, we are available for hire … although we are not particularly anxious to find more work, so our one-on-one user-specific consultations and training seminars are not free … they will be worth several times more than what they cost you, but they not free.</p>

<h1 id="site-reliability">Site Reliability</h1>

<p>This post is about making your most important infrastructure MORE RELIABLE … it is about OWNING the part of your network that your customers see and depend upon … even if you own NOTHING beneath the top surface of the skin of what customers see – THAT is all that matters to the infrastructure of your customer interaction and your network of customers.  It will be absolutely necessary to build that trusted network from underlying components that you cannot depend upon in the future and and should never, ever, ever trust … trust is like a hotel room – you do not and cannot EVER own trust, you must RENT it and it is up to YOU to engineer and ensure its reliability.  Reliability is partly about REDUNDANCY, but it is about constant vigilance and SITUATIONAL AWARENESS of where the vulnerabilities and weaknesses are.  A watched pot never boils, but when it does, you immediately make a switch … before the customer ever experiences a scalding spillover from that boiling pot.</p>

<p>*TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD  and much more TBD … the following ruminations, currently in-process will be from what I gain preparing to take part in a class that I am excited about … maybe you want to sign up for that class <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/data-science-for-security-professionals/0636920095781/">Data Science for Security Professionals</a></p>
