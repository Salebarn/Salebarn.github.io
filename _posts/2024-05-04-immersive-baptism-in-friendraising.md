***Stop going to church. Start BEING the church.***

# Auctioneering EVENTS are about FRIENDRAISING

**Stop going to church. Start BEING the church.**

FRIENDRAISING is about the RESURRECTION of body of believers in the Christian community ... building the body of believers and thus making the REAL spiritual church healthy will be done with or without physical churches and pharisaical institutional impediments to spreading the Gospel and the love of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The traditional bricks-and-mortar churches can play a very active role in building up the real SPIRITUAL church, but the idolators and worshippers of physcical structures rather than Christ will be left behind. 

This is why we believe that the dead should be left to bury their dead.

Friendraising events brings people together and accelerates various inter-church phatic conversations and deeper intra-church internal negotiations that restore spiritual life to churches and generally lead toward deeper, more empathetic friendships in the community ... in general, the strategic objective of Salebarn is about advancing the PR/outreach agenda of LIVING spiritual organizations that wish to be served by this process. 

**It's NOT about fundraising or about guilt-based checkbook charity or passing the collection plate in public to play on people's vanity and pride.** It's RADICALLY different than what you will find in the realm of conventional benefit auctioneering and fundraising consultants ... it's about EXERCISING atrophied community muscles and slowly building up the body of believers and making the REAL spiritual church healthy.

## Immersive training in order to TRAIN outreach leadership

This 200-module syllabus is for AUTODIDACTIC training to help recruit leaders and build a organizational faith-driven discipline for a year-long study of using events to *accelerate the negotiation* that is always happening as a ongoing conversation between an organization, the network of churches it serves and all people in the local community. 

The point of this exercise is to AUTODIDACTICALLY LEARN how to use ***friendraising*** or getting people out to events, not so much to donate, but mostly develop stronger faith-based friendships between members of churches and the people in the community ... the focus is not exactly on bringing in dollars -- that will happen if God wills these activities to be successful in that regard ... MOSTLY, the intent is advance the PR/outreach agenda of the organization we serve.

## 200 modules for a year-long immersive training program in Christian outreach leadership

Here is a 200-module syllabus for a year-long study of auctioneering based fundraising events for a Christian organization with excess thrift store merchandise to liquidate. 

PRACTICALLY, in pedagogical terms, the focus of these auctioneering events is about putting the training INTO PRACTICE ... this is not just a seminar that one attends and then goes back to the normal routine and forgets about it ... this is about a year-long study of *increasing the bid* ... that means that we set up a regular RHYTHMIC vibe that church leaders and community people start to understand and then find ways to participate in ... we need to have EVENTS that will work with the resources that we have ... of course, the events certain aspects of the small events will fail and we will learn from those failures to PRACTICALLY DESIGN BETTER AND BETTER events.

The POINT of this entire exercise is about *increasing the bid* ... SLOWLY building momentum ... working with the entire community to accelerate the negotiations that should always being happening as part of the ongoing conversations that are about BUILDING THE COMMUNITY.

In other words, the point doing this is to drive out NEGATIVE community behaviors such as gossiping, longing for better days of the past, focusing on negatives. 

BUILDING the community requires building momentum and excitement and FAITH ... walking WITH our people, WITH our churches is about serving the spiritual needs of people in the local community ... and it also about displacing the negative habits of being ourselves, being held back by our longing for the past or our fears of the community's future and the influx of NEW people and NEW spirtual needs ... BUILDING THE COMMUNITY requires RESURRECTION and EXERCISE of FAITH.

### Module 1-10: Introduction to Auctioneering and Fundraising

#### 1. Overview of auctioneering and its history

#### 2. Types of auctions and their formats

#### 3. The role of an auctioneer in fundraising events

**Benefit Auctioneers Specialists (BAS)** are [professionally trained and certified](https://www.auctioneers.org/content.asp?admin=Y&contentid=262) to be specialist in fundraising ... they develop worldwide peer networks with fellow BAS professionals. As professionals, their roles goes far beyond merely being an emcee **performing** at an event; it really goes beyond even just developing and implementing strategies for developing and managing a one-off successful fundraising benefit auction event ... fundraising is longer-term process of growing a donor base.  BAS professionals guide clients through series of consultations resulting in a successful event and building larger organizational reach. This about working with clients to identify methods to communicate professional links to committees, foundations, CEOs, and significant influencers promote the service and mission of the organization ... this will involve using different methods but it's about getting out a consistent message through different channels including content marketing through blogs, podcasts and all effective means of using digital and video marketing. It's really about transcending an effective stage/screen performance to maximize different revenue streams and fundraising potential for multiple event types, including revenue generators and revenue enhancers. A BAS professiona will be well-versed in the pros and cons of different approaches ... an in-person event, virtual webinar, hybrid conference, and online only fundraising mechanisms for various purposes. It really requires a professional approach to identify the technology and audio-visual best practices for each event type. Before events, it's necessary to work with clients to develop a script or run-of-show (ROS) dress rehearsal with the client that reinforces and supports fundraising as the event goal. Regardless of whether it's show on Broadway or Community Theater play or benefit event ... it has to be REHEARSED and taken seriously ... or **otherwise, why should ANYONE take the cause or the event seriously?**
